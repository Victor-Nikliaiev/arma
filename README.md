This is an app using NASA API for getting all information about upcoming asteroids. it shows some info about them. How hazardous they are, their size, approximate date of getting critical distance to the Earth and etc. You can pick asteroids to the basket to "destroy" them all at once or one by one.

It has capabilities to change measure units from kilometers to the Earth to distance of measuring moon. Also there is a checkbox where you can check only hazardous ones. If you click on the name you can get on the page with full description for the asteroid. Also all list of astroid dynamically paginating by small portions of data as soon as you will scroll near to down of the page.

This project was a fun to build. A lot of passion and patience were left there. Thank you everyone for inspiration and the opportunity to do that!
